        This machine learning competition is like no other. Teams will build Python programs that perform virtual trades
        on a given set of real stocks using a combination of ML and non-ML powered techniques.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>How it works</h4>
    <p class="text-justify">
        A training set consisting of historical data for a large number of real stocks will be provided to teams. Teams
        are expected to build a price-predicting machine learning model based on this data.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        All team's programs will be given the same initial amount of virtual money to 'invest'. The program will be
        provided the following multiple times:
        <ul class="list-disc ml-8">
            <li>New market data for that same set of stocks</li>
            <li>The current holdings of the program</li>
            <li>The program's available cash on hand</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
   <p class="text-justify">
    The program will be expected to make profit-maximising trades based on this data, using their machine learning model, deciding what stocks to buy or sell and in what amount. These trades will be used to update the position of the team and will be evaluated against the next day's market data to determine profits or losses. 
   </p>
   <p class="text-justify">
    Points will be awarded based on the amount of profit generated by the programs of teams. The performance of the model itself, in terms of accuracy or any other metric, will not be considered.
   </p>
   <br>
   <h4>Timeline</h4>
   <p class="text-justify">
    The dataset with historical data for the given stocks will be revealed on <strong>Friday, the 23rd of September </strong>. The expected format for submissions, as well as the script that will be used to test participant algorithms, will also be provided to participants at the same time.
   </p>
   <p class="text-justify">
    Submissions will be expected by <strong> 11:59 PM on the 2nd of October </strong>. The results for the event will be released by noon on the <strong> 12th of October </strong>. 
   </p>
