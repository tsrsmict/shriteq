        This machine learning competition is like no other. Teams will build Python programs that perform virtual trades
        on a given set of real stocks using a combination of ML and non-ML powered techniques.
    <ul class="list-disc ml-8">
        <li> A training set consisting of historical data for a large number of real stocks will be provided to teams. </li>
        <li> Teams are expected to build a price-predicting machine learning model based on this data. </li>
        <li> All teams’ programs will be given the same initial amount of virtual money to ‘invest’. </li>
        <li> The program will be fed the following data multiple times: </li>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-8">
            <li> New market data for that set of stocks </li>
            <li> The current holdings of the program </li>
            <li> The program’s available cash on hand </li>
        </ul>
        <li> The program will be expected to make profit-maximising trades based on this data, deciding what stocks to buy or sell and in what amount. </li>
        <li> These trades will be used to update the position of the team and will be evaluated against the next day’s market data to determine profits or losses.  </li>
        <li> Points will be awarded based on the amount of profit generated by the programs of teams.  </li>
        <li> The performance of the model itself, in terms of accuracy or any other metric, will not be considered. </li>
        <li> Teams will be provided the expected format for submissions as well as helpful resources the day the event opens</li>
    </ul>
