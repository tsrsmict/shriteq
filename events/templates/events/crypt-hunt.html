        Starting from <strong>00:00 AM on the 8th of October to 11 PM on the 11th of October </strong>, you and other students from your school will work together on virtual scavenger hunts across the internet, following clues starting from each question. The questions will cover technology, pop culture, entertainment, and more. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Schoolwide participation</h4>
    <p class="text-justify">
        Schools will progress together, meaning that any one participant from a school getting the answer for the school’s current question will advance the entire school. Participants from a given school will be able to discuss over their school’s official Discord channel on the Discord server for ShriTeq. 
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        A leaderboard of all schools displaying the serial number of their current question will be visible for the entire duration of the event. Points will be awarded to schools based on their position on the leaderboard at the end of the event.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Hints</h4>
    <p class="text-justify">The organising committee (OC) may periodically provide hints to schools. These may be standard global hints for all schools, or may be customised as per the progress of the school. The decisions of the OC when providing hints will be final and binding.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Rules</h4>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-8">
        <li>Participants are allowed to use the internet </li>
        <li>Schools are not allowed to discuss anything relating to the questions or their answers with other schools </li>
        <li> All discussions related to the event must take place in officially sanctioned environments, such as the official Discord channel for a given school. All calls, meetings or other forms of communication must have at least one organising committee member present at all times. </li>
        <li>Any attempt to gain the answers of questions through uncompetitive means, such as through attempts to hack the site, will be  strictly penalised.</li>
    </ul>
   </p>
   <p class="text-justify">
    Failure to comply with any of these rules could result in a temporary or permanent ban of the school from the event.
